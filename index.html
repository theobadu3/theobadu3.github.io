  <h1>Theo's Rankings.</h1>
  <p> My friend was thinking of creating a website (StatSite) that brings all the world's stats together in one website to make        one's journey easier. but i thought those are just numbers, players should be ranked how we think they should be not just by        numbers. Sports are not just stats. Sports include teamwork, leadership, sportsmanship, work ethic, and team spirit, and we the    generel public need to acknowledge this. </p>
